Text Editor Documentation
Introduction
The Text Editor is a simple program written in Python that allows the user to create, edit, and save plain text files. The editor supports syntax highlighting for several programming languages and includes options for selecting fonts and word wrapping. The program also includes a menu and toolbar with options for opening, saving, and editing text.

**Installation**

To install the Text Editor, download the source code from the GitHub repository or use git to clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/BorgorNinja/text-editor-py.git`
The program requires Python 3 and the tkinter module. To install tkinter on Ubuntu, use the following command:

`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
To install tkinter on Windows, tkinter is included with the standard Python distribution.

**Usage**

To run the Text Editor, navigate to the directory where the source code is located and run the text_editor.py file:

`cd text-editor-py
python main.py`

The Text Editor window will appear with a blank text area. To create a new file, simply start typing in the text area. To open an existing file, click on the "File" menu and select "Open". This will open a file dialog where you can select the file you want to open. The contents of the file will appear in the text area.

To save a file, click on the "File" menu and select "Save". This will save the contents of the text area to a file. If the file has not been saved before, a file dialog will appear where you can specify the file name and location.

The Text Editor also supports syntax highlighting for several programming languages. To enable syntax highlighting, simply type code in the text area using one of the supported languages. The editor will automatically highlight keywords, operators, and other elements in the code.

To select a font, click on the dropdown menu in the toolbar and select a font from the list. This will change the font of the text in the editor.

To enable word wrapping, click on the "Edit" menu and select "Wrap Text". This will wrap the text at the end of each line.
